# rockpaperscissors
A simple rock, paper, scissors game written in Python.

I mostly write code to process marketing and business data but I have little kids who are very interested in gaming. Since I never wrote a game before I thought it would be a fun exercise and something I could show them to spark their interest in computer programming.

I did not look up any other pre existing code. I just wanted to see if I could figure everything out on my own and make it work.

This game prompts the player for their name and then asks if they would like to play.

After the player inputs their choice, the program randomly makes its choice and the game continues. Score is kept and based on different outcomes the player is regularly prompted to see if they would like to continue. The game also taunts the player a bit.
